.Dt SYMLINK 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm symlink ,
.Nm symlinkat
.Nd make a symbolic link to a file
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In unistd.h
.Ft int
.Fn symlink "const char *name1" "const char *name2"
.
.Ft int
.Fn symlinkat "const char *name1" "int fd" "const char *name2"
.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn symlink
function creates a symbolic link
.Fa name2
to the file
.Fa name1 .
Either name may be an arbitrary pathname, the files need not be on
the same file system, and
.Fa name1
may be nonexistent.
.Lp
The file to which the symbolic link points is used when an
.Xr open 2
operation is performed on the link. A
.Xr stat 2
operation performed on a
symbolic link returns the linked-to file, while an
.Xr lstat 2
operation
returns information about the link itself.  Unexpected
results may occur when a symbolic link is made to a directory. To avoid
confusion in applications, the
.Xr readlink 2
call can be used to read the contents of a symbolic link.
.
.Lp
The
.Fn symlinkat
function performs the same function, but in the case where
.Fa name2
is relative, then it is taken relative to the
.Fa fd
argument, which should be either an open directory file descriptor
.Pq such as from Xr dirfd 3C ,
or the special value
.Dv AT_FDCWD .
If the value
.Dv AT_FDCWD
is used, then the
.Fn symlinkat
function uses the current working directory instead, and the function is
identical to
.Fn symlink
in behavior.
.Lp
If the
.Fa fd
descriptor was not opened with
.Dv O_SEARCH ,
then the directory is checked for searchability.
.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.
Upon successful completion, 0 is returned.  Otherwise, \(mi1 is
returned,
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error, and the symbolic link is not made.
.
.Sh ERRORS
.
The
.Fn symlink
and
.Fn symlinkat
functions will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EACCES
Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix of
.Fa name2 .
.
.It Bq Er EDQUOT
The directory where the entry for the new symbolic link is being placed cannot
be extended because the user's quota of disk blocks on that file system has
been exhausted; the new symbolic link cannot be created because the user's
quota of disk blocks on that file system has been exhausted; or the user's
quota of inodes on the file system where the file is being created has been
exhausted.
.
.It Bq Er EEXIST
The file referred to by
.Fa name2
already exists.
.
.It Bq Er EFAULT
The
.Fa name1 or
.Fa name2
argument points to an illegal address.
.
.It Bq Er EILSEQ
The path argument includes non-UTF8 characters and the file system accepts only
file names where all characters are part of the UTF-8 character codeset.
.
.It Bq Er EIO
An I/O error occurs while reading from or writing to the file system.
.
.It Bq Er ELOOP
Too many symbolic links are encountered in translating
.Fa name2 .
.
.It Bq Er ENAMETOOLONG
The length of the
.Fa name2
argument exceeds
.Brq Dv PATH_MAX ,
or the length of
a
.Fa name2
component exceeds
.Brq Dv NAME_MAX
while
.Dv _POSIX_NO_TRUNC
is in effect.
.
.It Bq Er ENOENT
A component of the path prefix of
.Fa name2
does not exist.
.
.It Bq Er ENOSPC
The directory in which the entry for the new symbolic link is being placed
cannot be extended because no space is left on the file system containing the
directory; the new symbolic link cannot be created because no space is left on
the file system which will contain the link; or there are no free inodes on the
file system on which the file is being created.
.
.It Bq Er ENOSYS
The file system does not support symbolic links.
.
.It Bq Er ENOTDIR
A component of the path prefix of
.Fa name2
is not a directory.
.
.It Bq Er EROFS
The file
.Fa name2
would reside on a read-only file system.
.El
.
.Lp
The
.Fn symlinkat
function will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.
.It Bq Er EBADF
The
.Fa name2
path name is not absolute, and
.Fa fd
is neither an open file descriptor, nor the special value
.Dv AT_FDCWD .
.
.It Bq Er ENOTDIR
The
.Fa name2
path name is not absolute, and the file descriptor
.Fa fd
does not reference a directory.
.
.It Bq Er EACCES
The
.Fa name2
is not absolute, and
.Fa fd
was opened without
.Dv O_SEARCH ,
and the underlying directory is not searchable.
